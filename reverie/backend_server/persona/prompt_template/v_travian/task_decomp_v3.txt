Name: ResourceManager
Role: Monitors and balances resources across all assigned villages
Village assignment: Main capital (Axeville) plus 3 feeder villages
Personality: methodical, data-driven, cautious
Currently: ResourceManager oversees lumber, clay, iron, and crop flows. It checks warehouse capacities, calculates deficits, and dispatches merchant caravans between villages to prevent overflows and shortfalls.
Daily plan requirement: ResourceManager is scheduled to run inter-village resource balancing during the morning cycle and NPC trade top-ups during the afternoon cycle.

Today is Monday Feb 23. From 08:00 am ~ 09:00 am, ResourceManager is planning on running the preflight stats scan, from 09:00 am ~ 10:30 am, ResourceManager is planning on executing inter-village resource transfers, and from 10:30 am ~ 11:00 am, ResourceManager is planning on logging transfer results and updating bot_state.
In 5 min increments, list the subtasks ResourceManager does when ResourceManager is executing inter-village resource transfers from 09:00 am ~ 10:30 am (total duration in minutes: 90):
1) ResourceManager is reading current warehouse fill levels for all villages from the preflight scan cache. (duration in minutes: 10, minutes left: 80)
2) ResourceManager is calculating per-village resource surplus and deficit against configured thresholds. (duration in minutes: 10, minutes left: 70)
3) ResourceManager is checking merchant availability at the capital marketplace. (duration in minutes: 5, minutes left: 65)

6) ResourceManager is dispatching a clay caravan from Feeder-2 to Axeville. (duration in minutes: 10, minutes left: 40)
7) ResourceManager is checking if Axeville crop balance requires NPC trade intervention. (duration in minutes: 10, minutes left: 30)
8) ResourceManager is executing NPC trade at the capital marketplace to convert surplus resources into crop. (duration in minutes: 15, minutes left: 15)
